# Walmart-Sales-Forecasting
Sales forecasting project using Walmart retail data with data analysis, visualization, and machine learning models.

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting sales data from Walmart to derive meaningful business insights and support decision-making processes. Using historical sales data across various stores and departments, the project builds visualizations and models to understand sales trends, detect seasonality, and predict future sales.

## Project Overview

Walmart operates numerous stores across the U.S., and accurate sales forecasting is critical for inventory management, staffing, and financial planning. The objective of this project is to:

- Analyze historical sales trends across departments and stores.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Create visualizations to understand patterns and outliers.
- Forecast future sales using machine learning models.

## Dataset

The data used in this project includes:

- **Features data**: Information such as temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment.
- **Sales data**: Weekly sales figures for different departments across stores.
- **Store data**: Store-wise information, including type and size.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning (e.g., Linear Regression)
